<h1><a class="anchor" name="lxrt_faq">LXRT-INFORMED FAQs</a></h1>Pierre Cloutiers: How does LXRT works?<p>
This one pager is an attempt to explain conceptually how LXRT works. It does not try to get into the nifty gritty details of the implementation but it tries to explain how the context of execution switches between Linux and RTAI.<p>
But first, what are we trying to do?<p>
LXRT provides a family of real time scheduler services that can be used by both real time RTAI tasks and Linux tasks. To keep things simple for the programmer the implementation is fully symmetric. In other words, the same function calls are used in both the kernel and user space.<p>
What are those real time scheduler services?<p>
RTAI provides the standard services like resume, yield, suspend, make periodic, wait until etc. You will also find semaphores, mail boxes, remote procedure calls, send and receive primitives integrated into the state machine of the real time scheduler. Typically, the IPC function calls support:<p>
. Blocking until the transaction occurs. . Returning immediately if the other end is not ready. . Blocking for the transaction until a timeout occurs.<p>
How do I setup my Linux program for LXRT?<p>
You call rt_task_init( name, ...). The call differs from the real time counterpart (there are a few exceptions to the symmetry rule) in that, among other things, you provide a name for your program. The name must be unique and is registered by LXRT. Thus, other programs, real time or not, can find the task pointer of your program and communicate with it.<p>
LXRT creates a real time task who becomes the "angel" of your program. The angel's job is to execute the real time services for you. For example, if you call rt_sleep(...), LXRT will get your angel to execute the real <a class="el" href="api_8c.html#a32">rt_sleep()</a> function in the real time scheduler. Control will return to your program when the angel returns from <a class="el" href="api_8c.html#a32">rt_sleep()</a>.<p>
With LXRT, can a Linux task send a message to a real time task?<p>
Yes. You simply use the rt_send(...) primitive that you would normally use in the code of a kernel program. LXRT gets your angel to execute rt_send(...). Control returns to your program when the target task completes the corresponding rt_receive(...) call.<p>
What happens when I send a message to another user space program?<p>
Well, pretty much the same thing except that you now have two angels talking to each other...<p>
Can a real time task also register a name with LXRT?<p>
Yes. The call rt_register( name, ...) does that. Thus, other programs, real time or not, can find the task pointer of your program and communicate with it.<p>
Where do I put the code for the "angels"?<p>
There is not any code required for the real time component of your Linux task. LXRT uses the standard RTAI scheduler functions for that. In the QNX world, the "angel" is called a virtual circuit.<p>
How does it work from the point of view of a user space program?<p>
The inline functions declared in rtai_lxrt.h all do a software interrupt (int 0xFC). Linux system calls use the software int 0x80. Hence the approach is similar to a system call. LXRT sets the interrupt vector to call rtai_lxrt_handler(void), a function that saves everything on the stack, changes ds and es to __KERNEL_DS and then calls lxrt_handler, the function that does the work.<p>
lxrt_handler(...) extracts the first argument from user space and decides what to do from the service request number srq. For real time services, lxrt_resume(...) is called with the scheduler function address pointer fun, the number of remaining arguments, a pointer to the next argument, a service type argument, and the real time task pointer. lxrt_resume(...) will do what is necessary to change the context of execution to RTAI and transfer execution to the specified function address in the real time scheduler.<p>
lxrt_resume(...) first copies the other arguments on the stack of the real time task. Any required data is also extracted from user space and copied into rt_task-&gt;msg_buf. At this point, the addresses of three functions are stored above stack_top (LXRT made sure this wizardry would be possible when it first created the real time task):<p>
top-1 lxrt_suspend(...) top-2 fun(...) top-3 lxrt_global_sti(...)<p>
The stack is changed to point to top-3, global interrupts are disabled and and the context of execution is switched to RTAI with the call to LXRT_RESUME (rt_task). RTAI executes lxrt_global_sti(...), fun(...), and eventually lxrt_suspend(...). Remember that fun(...) is a RTAI scheduler function like, for example, rt_rpc(...). At this point, fun(...) may or may not complete.<p>
The easy way back to user space - fun(...) completes immediately:<p>
RTAI enters function lxrt_suspend(...) that sets the real time task status to 0 and calls rt_schedule(). The context of execution is eventually switched back to Linux and the system call resumes after LXRT_RESUME(rt_task). Data for mail boxes is copied to user space and a jump to ret_from_intr() is made to complete the system call.<p>
The long way back to user space - fun(...) cannot completed immediately:<p>
RTAI schedules Linux to run again and the state of the real time task is non zero, indicating it is held. Therefore, the system call cannot return to user space and must wait. So it sets itself TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and calls the Linux scheduler.<p>
Eventually fun(...) completes and RTAI enters function lxrt_suspend(...) that notices the system call is held. So RTAI pends a system call request to instruct Linux to execute another system call whose handler is function lxrt_srq_handler(void). When Linux calls lxrt_srq_handler(), the original system call is re-scheduled for execution and returns to user space as explained above.<p>
What happens to the registered resources if the Linux task crashes?<p>
The "informed" version of LXRT has setup a pointer to a callback function in the do_exit() code of the Linux kernel. The callback is used to free the resources that where registered by the real time task. It also deletes the real time task and unblocks any other task that may have been SEND, RPC, RETURN or SEM blocked on the real time task.<p>
What about mail boxes?<p>
The mail box IPC approach is connection less. In other words, it is not possible for a zombie real time task to detect that another task is MBX blocked specifically for a message from him. The solution here is to use the rt_mbx_receive_timed() with a timeout value and verify the return value to detect the error.<p>
What about performance?<p>
Intertask communications with LXRT are about 36% faster than with old FIFO's. Testing Linux ó Linux communications with int size msg and rep's on a P233 I got these numbers:<p>
LXRT 12,000 cycles RTAI-0.9x :-) LXRT 13,000 cycles RTAI-0.8 Fifo 19,000 cycles RTAI-0.8 Fifo new 22,300 cycles RTAI-0.8 10% more cycles, a lot more utilities (that cause some overhead) SRR 14,200 cycles QNX 4 Send/Receive/Reply implemented with a Linux module without a real time executive. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Tue Jan 18 22:53:53 2005 for RTAI API by&nbsp;
