# About RTAI


Are you...

- Tired of expensive realtime operating systems?
- Looking for deterministic response to interrupts?
- Working with POSIX compliant or native **RTAI** realtime tasks?
- Searching for friendly community support?
- All that on top of a general purpose operating system with penguins inside?

Then **RTAI** might be the realtime extension of your choice! The Realtime Application Interface consists mainly of two parts:

A patch to the Linux kernel which introduces a hardware abstraction layer
A broad variety of services which make realtime programmers' life easier

**RTAI** is a true community project. Just download and try it out - the developers are looking forward to your comments, ideas and other help to make **RTAI** one of the best realtime extensions available!

This website is the master resource for all kind of information about **RTAI**. If you feel it's interesting for you subscribe to our users' mailing list where all kinds of topics related to **RTAI** can be discussed.
