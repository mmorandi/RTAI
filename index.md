# RTAI - Real Time Application Interface Official Website 

---

### **It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of Prof. Paolo Mantegazza, the driving force behind the Real-Time Application Interface (RTAI) project.**

### **Prof. Mantegazza will be greatly missed, but his contributions will continue to inspire us all.**

This is the homepage of **RTAI** - the **RealTime Application Interface** for **Linux** - which lets you write applications with strict timing constraints for your favorite operating system. Like Linux itself, this software is a community effort. If you are interested in what it does, just join our mailing list and help our team!

**RTAI** supports:

- x86 (with and without FPU and TSC)
- x86_64
- ARM (obsolete support; it is being reworked)

 
Older versions of **RTAI** also supported:

- PowerPC
- m68k (supporting both MMU and NOMMU cpus)

The **RTAI** distribution includes **RTAI-Lab**, a tool chain to convert block diagrams into **RTAI** 
executables and to monitor their operation on various targets.

# SVN:
[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/rtai](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/rtai)

Two development branches are available:
  - **vesuvio** : this branch is relatively stable, and can be used, with some caution, for production
  - **magma** : this branch can be in an unstable state, but it should be possible to use it as well
